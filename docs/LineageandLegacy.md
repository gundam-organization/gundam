GUNDAM was born as a fork of the *xsllhFitter* project which was developped and used by
the cross-section working group of T2K. The original project can be found on *gitlab*:
[https://gitlab.com/cuddandr/xsLLhFitter](https://gitlab.com/cuddandr/xsLLhFitter).

GUNDAM has originally been developed as an new fitter to perform T2K oscillation
analysis, and provide an expandable base on which future studies with the *Upgraded
ND280 Detectors* will be performed.
