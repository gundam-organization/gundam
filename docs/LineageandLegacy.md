GUNDAM was primarily developed as a tool for conducting sensitivity studies with the *Upgraded
ND280 Detector*. Originally, it was created as a fork of the xsllhFitter project, 
which was developed and used by the T2K cross-section Working Group. The original project is 
available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/cuddandr/xsLLhFitter). GUNDAM also benefits from over 10 years 
of expertise gained by the T2K Oscillation Analysis Working Group through the near-detector 
analysis part of the T2K oscillation analysis, which uses the internal software BANFF.

Designed as a general-purpose tool, GUNDAM is intended for use in a variety of analyses and collaborations.
