# Super-xsllhFitter

## Introduction

The goal of the Super-xsllhFitter is to provide a general purpose likelihood-based fit framework for performing cross section analyses. The current state of the code and documentation is very much work in progress and is only kind of ready for general use. However, if you're desperate or can't wait then read on! There is no guarantee the fitter will be able to perform your analysis.

The code is under very active development and to give some kind of stability, it is recommended you checkout/download a tagged version of the fitter. The code is hosted on GitLab, and can be found here: [xsLLhFitter](https://gitlab.com/cuddandr/xsLLhFitter).

This document is currently all about the code for the fitter. For anything related to the principles behind the fitter, browse any of the following technotes: TN214, TN261, TN263, TN287, TN337, TN338.
