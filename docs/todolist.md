## To-Do List

List of things in no particular order that I am looking at improving in the fit:

+ Functionality to run a fit again with a smaller/larger tolerance
+ Functionality to change the eigen decomosition method from config file
+ CLI override options for `xsllhFit`
+ Better error handling
+ Better documenation
