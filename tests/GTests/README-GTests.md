# Unit tests written using GoogleTest

This directory contains the source files for unit tests written using
the GoogleTest library.  The GoogleTest library will need to have been
externally installed on the system running the tests.  If it is found
by cmake, then these tests will be added to `make test` and run under
the control of ctest.
