# Run tests on gundam.  Test scripts that are kept in the fast-tests
# subdirectory will always be run.  Any test scripts that take a lot
# of time and are for more detailed validation should be kept in
# slow-tests.  Tests that are not part of "fast-tests" will only be
# run when the applicable options are set.  The apply option ("-a")
# must be added to actually run the scripts.
#
# The testing levels are:
#
#    fast-tests/ -- Always run and used during continuous integration.
#
#    regular-tests/ -- Quick tests that are not used for CI, but
#       should be run locally before a push/pull-request Run when "-r"
#       is provided.  They are run after and can use results from the
#       fast-tests.  (Plan to get a dring of water while these tests run).
#
#    extended-tests/ -- Slower tests that are run when "-e" is
#       provided.  These tests should finish in well under 30 seconds,
#       and all of the tests should take less than a few minutes.
#       They are run after and can use results from the fast and
#       regular tests. (Plan to take a coffee break while these tests
#       run).
#
#    slow-tests/ -- Long validation tests.  Only run with "-s" is
#       provided.  These tests are run after all other tests are
#       finished. (Plan to work on something else while these tests
#       run).
#
# This needs to be run in the tests subdirectory (which contains this
# script).  Any tests that are expected to fail should be listed in
# the EXPECTED_FAILURES file (by file name relative to the tests
# directory) where there is an example called
# "fast-tests/090ExpectedFailure.sh" that is part of the testing
# framework.
#
# Validation scripts can be any executable file, but are generally
# written in bash or python.  They are run in a separate execution
# directory with command line
#
# cd <output> && <script> <directory>
#
# Where <output> is directory where the script is run, <script> is the
# full path of the test script, and <directory> is the full path of
# the directory containing the test script.  Any necessary
# configuration files should be saved in the same directory as the
# script.
#
# The gundam-tests.sh script will run all of the executable scripts in
# the script directories (i.e. fast-tests and/or slow-tests) that
# start with a digit.  The list of scripts to be run are printed
# before they start to run.  All of the fast-tests are run before all
# of the slow-tests (i.e. slow-tests can use output from fast-tests)
#
# The validation scripts are run in the order of increasing speed, so
# fast-tests are run before slow-tests.  Tests in a particular
# category (e.g. fast-tests) are run in lexical order based on the
# script name.  This means that script "001MyName" is run before
# "002MyName", so users have controll of the script order. The
# following convention is suggested for script naming.
#
#    000-099 -- Reserved for gundam-tests.sh.  This is where job
#               headers and similar things can be generated.
#
#    100-199 -- Scripts which don't require input.  This includes any
#               scripts generating input data that can be used by the
#               later tests.
#
#    200-299 -- Scripts which generate gundam output files.  These
#               scripts mostly apply fits.
#
#    800-899 -- Scripts which produce summary files.
#
#    900-998 -- Scripts looking at summary files and checking results
#
#    999 -- Reserved for gundam-tests.sh.  This is where job
#               completion information is generated.
#
# NAMING CONVENTION EXAMPLE: This is how the naming convention works
# in practice.  This is how a script that runs a GUNDAM fit that takes
# a binning and configuration file might be named.
#
#   fast-test/
#     200RunGUNDAM.sh          -- The script
#     200RunGUNDAM-config.yaml -- The configuration file
#     200RunGUNDAM-binning.txt -- The binning file.
#
#   The output file should be named 200RunGUNDAM.root (or similar as
#   needed).
