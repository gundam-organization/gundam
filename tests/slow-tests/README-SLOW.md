# Validation scripts for gundam-tests.sh

This directory contains scripts that can take a long time to run.
Each script should probably finish within a "few" minutes, but there
is no particular time limit.  See the gundam-tests.sh script for
documentation on the file naming convention.

This file should exist so that git will create the slow-tests
subdirectory
