// A factory that will build DialBase objects and return the pointer to the
// object.  It's written as a class instead of as a function in case we want
// to close around values, and the normal implemenation would be as a functor,
// but that doesn't work well in some IDEs.  This will use other factories to
// build the dials, so try to keep the interaces uniform (there isn't tight
// inheritance relationship, and C++ isn't good at pure "interface" classes).
// The ownership of the object is passed to the caller so the pointer should
// be put into a managed pointer (e.g. unique_ptr, or shared_ptr).

  // Construct a pointer to the correct DialBase.  The dial title is provided
  // so that better error messages can be printed. This uses the dialType and
  // dialSubType to figure out the correct class, and then uses the object
  // pointed to by the dialInitializer to fill the dial.  The initializer is
  // not a constant due to constraints from ROOT.  NOTE: The ownership of the
  // pointer is passed to the caller, so it should be put in a managed
  // variable (e.g. a unique_ptr, or shared_ptr).
